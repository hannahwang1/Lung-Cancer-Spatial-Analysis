# Spatial Distribution and Association of the Relative Risk of Lung Cancer Incidence by Census Tracts Between 2013-2017 Across New York State (NYS) with Particulate Matter (PM) 2.5 microns and Adult Smoking Rates at the County Level

This is a cross-sectional analysis of the state-wide population-based dataset from the New York State Cancer Registry (NYSCR), which provides incident lung cancer observed and expected cases aggregated at the census-tract level for the diagnosis years from 2013-2017. The analysis aims to investigate whether clustering is statistically significant or whether it is likely to be a chance occurrence or is simply a reflection of the distribution of the population at risk. In other words, does the observed spatial pattern differ significantly from the null hypothesis of complete spatial randomness.

## Datasets

•	United States Census Bureau "2010 TIGER/Line Shapefiles” from https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/index.php.

•	2013-2017 NYSCR Cancer Incidence by Census Tract publicly-use dataset provided courtesy of NYS Dept. of Health (NYSDoH) as a SAS datafile.

•	2019 County Health Rankings and Roadmaps for NYS -- https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/app/new-york/2019/downloads -- contains aggregated measures of PM 2.5 and adult smoking rates at the county-level collated from other primary sources of data: 

    •	The original source of the air pollution data is the Environmental Public Health Tracking Network, in which air particulate matter is the average daily density of fine particulate matter in micrograms per cubic meter (PM2.5) from 2014

    •	The original source of % of adults who are current smokers is the individual-level Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey from 2016
